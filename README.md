# hello-world
My “hello-world” repository. A place where ideas are born, resources are stored. A place to share and discuss things with others Creators, Developers, and LightWorkers of the New Earth. 
I Create 3-D Gatherings, support and facilitate events, medicine ceremonies, and collaborate in creating a New Template for Human Life on Planet Eartg as truly free and sovereign Beings, without the need for government or many of the "centralized" systems of the dying age of Pisces. I Am also beginning to produce electronic music, love the outdoors, nature, all animals, father of a 22 year old, and honor Great Spirit in all I do.
